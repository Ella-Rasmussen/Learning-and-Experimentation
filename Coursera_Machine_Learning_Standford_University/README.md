# Coursera Machine Learning Course from Stanford University 
In May 2016 I completed the Coursera Machine Learning Course, taught by Andrew Ng from Standford University. These files contain the assignments completed during this course that involved machine learning techniques including linear regression, logistic regression, support vector machines, and neural networks.
